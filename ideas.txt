Core Features

1.	Crypto Selection and Graph Display
	•	Use the CoinGecko API for price data, market metrics, and historical trends.
	•	For graphing, use Chart.js or Recharts in your React app to plot price data dynamically.

2.	Prediction Models
	•	Implement models in Python and serve predictions via Flask:
        •	Linear Regression: Simple trend analysis.
        •	LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Better for time-series prediction.
        •	ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average): Focus on statistical analysis.
    •	Display results on a graph in green based on the previous range and future range (both user input)

3.	Safety Score
	•	Fetch metrics for safety assessment:
        •	Token vesting schedules: Check for locked tokens and distribution patterns.
        •	Liquidity metrics: Look for locked liquidity pools.
        •	Volume trends: Sudden high volumes often indicate manipulation.
        •	Developer activity: Analyze GitHub commits or public updates.
    •	Aggregate metrics into one safety score (out of 100), and display + explain to user

4.	Key Metrics
	•	Display data like:
        •	Current price, volume, and market cap.
        •	Circulating supply and total supply.
        •	Historical performance (e.g., % change over the last 7 days).

Stretching Features
1.	Risk Assessment Heatmap
	•	Overlay a heatmap on the graph to visually indicate periods of high risk (e.g., low liquidity, large shareholder unlock events).
2.	Portfolio Integration
	•	Allow users to import their portfolio from MetaMask and provide predictions/safety scores for their holdings.
3.	Social Sentiment Analysis
	•	Scrape Twitter or Reddit for sentiment data and display a sentiment score (e.g., bullish, bearish).
4.	Educational Insights
	•	Add tooltips explaining metrics like “market cap,” “volume,” or “liquidity lock,” so beginners feel more confident.

Potential new ideas
1.	“What If” Scenarios
	•	Let users simulate potential investments: “If you had invested $1000 X days ago, what would it be worth today?”
2.	Volatility Score
	•	Display a volatility score to indicate how risky a crypto is based on historical price swings.
3.	API Access for Advanced Users
	•	Expose an API so users can programmatically fetch safety scores or predictions.
4.	Community Contributions
	•	Allow users to rate or provide feedback on safety scores or predictions, making the app community-driven.
