General plan

High level
1.	Learn Cryptocurrency Basics:
	•	Understand blockchain concepts, cryptocurrency markets, and APIs like CoinGecko or Binance for accessing historical and live market data.
2.	Learn Machine Learning for Time Series Analysis:
	•	Study how to handle time-series data (e.g., cryptocurrency prices).
	•	Train models like ARIMA, LSTMs, or Prophet to predict price trends.
	•	Use Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras, or PyTorch.
3.	Build a Backend for the Prediction System:
	•	Use Python to create a server for model inference.
	•	Implement APIs using Flask or FastAPI.
4.	Learn Smart Contracts for Interaction:
	•	Write Solidity contracts for handling user interactions and payments on the blockchain.
5.	Connect Frontend with Backend and Blockchain:
	•	Use React.js for the frontend.
	•	Integrate predictions and blockchain interactions using Ethers.js or Web3.js.
6.	Deploy the DApp:
	•	Host the frontend on IPFS or Fleek.
	•	Deploy the smart contracts on Ethereum or a test network like Polygon Mumbai.
